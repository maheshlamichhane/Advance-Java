Introduction to Advance Java:-> with core java we can develop two type of application.

Amirpet Concept which is wrong:-> 
i. Standalone Application
   -> GUI Based Application(Desktop Application) Eg calc,notepad,video games and paint etc.
   -> CUI Based Application(Console Application) Eg cmd java demo
ii. Web Application(JDBC,Servlet,JSP can be used to develop web application)


According to sun microsystem there are 3 edition:->
i. Java Standard Edition(J2SE or JSE) -> Core Java + JDBC -> Standlone application
ii. Java Enterprise Edition(J2EE or JEE) -> Servelt + JSP -> web and enterprise application
iii. Java Micro Edition(J2ME or JME) 					  -> mobile and embedded application


Basic Components Of JDBC Application:->
i. Driver -> Translator
ii. Connection -> Road
iii. Statement -> Vehicle
iv.  ResultSet -> Box


Steps to develop JDBC Application:->
i. Load and Register Driver
ii. Establish Connection between java application and database
iii. Creation of statement object
iv. Send and execute SQL Query
v. Process Result from ResultSet
vi. Close connection
